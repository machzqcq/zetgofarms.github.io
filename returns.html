	<p>Please review the below information to find answers to any of your questions regarding our policies.</p>

	<h3>Returns</h3>
	<p>We do NOT accept any returns. Below are some of the reasons</p>
	<ul>
		<li>We are a small mom-and-pop practice and started growing organic produce this year, and we hardly make any profits</li>
		<li>We expect you take the product at the point-of-sale as-is with eye-inspection. Since it is produce, it can go bad in as little as few hours , so extremely difficult for us to take returns</li>
	</ul>
